+ big rework. ATStreamSearch works now. ATBinHex methods FindFirst/FindNext work now. Only case-insensitive search don't work for non-ascii text. Hard todo.
+ add: buttons Find/FindNext in demo
+ add: keys Home/End to goto file begin/end, in fixed modes
+ add: hide v-scrollbar in fixed modes (hex/ binary/ u-hex)
- fix: OnScroll wasn't called in many cases
- fix: huge file, if v-scrollbar dragged to end, file must also scroll to end
